# face_recognition_demo_OpenVINO
This example demonstrates an approach to create interactive applications
for video processing. It shows the basic architecture for building model
pipelines supporting model placement on different devices and simultaneous
parallel or sequential execution using OpenVINO library in Python.
In particular, this demo uses 3 models to build a pipeline able to detect
faces on videos, their keypoints (aka "landmarks"),
and recognize persons using the provided faces database
